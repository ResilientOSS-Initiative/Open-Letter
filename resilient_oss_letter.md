# Call to Action: Standardization of Open Source Sustainability and Maintainability

__To Corporations and Stakeholders in the Open Source Ecosystem:__

This letter serves as a statement of understanding and a call to action regarding the
critical need for establishing and adhering to a standard on open source sustainability
and maintainability in the long term. The health of our technology supply chains is
increasingly reliant on the robustness and longevity of open source projects. Therefore,
it is imperative that we collectively commit to fostering a sustainable and maintainable
open source ecosystem.


## The Importance of Open Source Sustainability

Open source software is the backbone of much of today's technology. It drives innovation,
reduces costs, and fosters collaboration across the globe. This is, indeed, one of the
solutions to the increasing geopolitical tensions across countries by allowing them to
operate independently with the advantages of cross-collaboration. Digital sovereignty
is becoming more important and open source allows transparency in the collaboration
process to avoid building virtual barriers.

At the same time, open source also presents an essential challenge: making sure
projects have active and healthy communities and are able to thrive over the long
term. 

A sustainable open source ecosystem ensures:
* __Reliability__: Maintained and updated software reduces vulnerabilities and ensures
  consistent performance.
* __Innovation__: Active communities drive continuous improvement and innovation.
* __Security__: Regular security audits and patches protect against potential threats.
* __Reduced Risk__: Sustainable projects mitigate the risk of costly supply chain attacks
  and disruptions.


## The Need for a New Standard

The addition of new internal processes at corporations would allow for early detection
of poorly maintained or unsustainable projects the corporation relies on. In the same
way that corporations grow with their partners, critical open source software should
grow with the corporation. Risk management should not only be an action to drop a
project, but an opportunity to sustain those unknown projects that are critical for
the digital infrastructure.

It is the right time to have a conversation with those ecosystems that are key to
the success of the corporation and stop simply consuming software, as this brings
by default inherited risks that may impact the revenue stream or branding.
Corporations limit the impact of supply chain attacks by creating best practices on
sustainability and maintainability for the open source supply chain. This requires
specific new processes to identify, manage, and mitigate those risks. And it
requires having a better understanding of where and how open source is used internally.


## Key Areas for Action

To achieve a standard of open source sustainability and maintainability, we propose
the following key areas of action:

* __Collaborate on defining an industry-related process for sustainability and maintainability__:
  * Grow a common understanding of sustainability and maintainability.
  * Define a set of new internal processes to identify risks in the supply chain
    related to sustainability and maintainability.
  * Adopt and test such internal processes.
  * Work on a common set of practices to raise a new standard for the industry.
* __Engage with open source ecosystems__: Corporate partners regularly have strategic
  discussions on how to grow together. These types of conversations should also
  happen between players in the open source ecosystems.
* __Support open source talent__: Allowing the growth of professional and paid positions
  in open source projects and fostering internal talent at corporations can bridge
  the discussion between business and development needs.
* __Mutualize costs and risks__: The rise of new legislation like the CRA in Europe
  is moving open source into a regulated market with its own associated risks to
  cybersecurity. This will force the specialization and creation of new stewards
  who will take care of those aspects and corporate players will need to play a
  key role in sustaining them.


## Letter of Understanding

By acknowledging and supporting this call to action, corporations and stakeholders
agree to:

* Recognize the importance of open source sustainability and maintainability.
* Actively support relevant open source projects through financial contributions,
  developer time, and community engagement.
* Advocate for and adopt best practices in open source management and development.
* Work collaboratively with other stakeholders to establish and maintain a
  standard for open source sustainability.


## Next Steps

We encourage all stakeholders to join us in this effort. Let us work together to
ensure the long-term health and vitality of the open source ecosystem, which is
critical to the future of technology.

We propose the following next steps:
* Organize a series of workshops and discussions to further define sustainability
  and maintainability.
* Establish a working group to develop guidelines and best practices.
* Commit to try and test those guidelines internally with the purpose of
  fine-tuning them.
* Learn and establish new internal practices with the purpose of growing awareness
  and identifying sustainability and maintainability risks.
* Grow a common set of practices with the purpose of standardizing them in the
  medium and long term.

  

We believe that through collective action we can create a sustainable and thriving open source ecosystem that benefits everyone.
